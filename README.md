Each tag used to define the purpose of the text thatâ€™s inside of it follow a particular syntax. It begins with an opening tag, which is also the tag name, and ends with a close tag. For example, a paragraph tag would look like <p> </p> (the slash indicates that it is a closing tag). The element content, or the words viewed on screen, is placed inside the tags. These 3 factors make up the element.
