3.	What is HTML?
HTML stand for Hypertext Markup Language and is used to depict the content of websites. It contains three main sections, the head, body, and footer. HTML contains several elements, and these elements are used to properly display a website. Each separate web page has its own HTML file, for example, an About, Contact, and Main page of a website would each have their own HTML file. 
4.	Proper syntax for HTML tags
Each tag used to define the purpose of the text that’s inside of it follow a particular syntax. It begins with an opening tag, which is also the tag name, and ends with a close tag. For example, a paragraph tag would look like <p> </p> (the slash indicates that it is a closing tag). The element content, or the words viewed on screen, is placed inside the tags. These 3 factors make up the element. 
5.	Explain or demonstrate commonly used html tags/elements:
headings: h1-h6
Headings are used to mark headings according to their importance. <h1> is most important, and only one can be contained within an HTML file. <h6> is the least important, and the smallest. 
P
<p> is a paragraph tag, and paragraphs must always start on a new line. 
lists: ul, ol, dl
<ul> stand for unordered list, <ol> stands for ordered list, and <dl> stands for description list. <ul> and <ol> contain <li>, or list items, and <dl> contains both <dt> (term or name) and <dd> (description of term). HTML configures these lists and gives them certain properties which can be altered using CSS. 
a
<a> is an anchor element. The opening a indicates where a link starts, and the closing a indicates where a link ends, meaning it creates a hyperlink. It must also contain a href attribute, meaning its value will equal a URL.
